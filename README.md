# Clustering Techniques:

Clustering is a Machine Learning technique that involves the grouping of data points. Given a set of data points, we can use a clustering algorithm to classify each data point into a specific group. Below are the clustering techniques that are implemented:

**K-Means Clustering:**

K-means clustering aims to partition data into k clusters in a way that data points in the same cluster are similar and data points in the different clusters are farther apart. Similarity of two points is determined by the distance between them.

**Hierarchical Clustering:**

It is an algorithm that groups similar objects into groups called clusters. The endpoint is a set of clusters, where each cluster is distinct from each other cluster, and the objects within each cluster are broadly similar to each other.

**Gaussian Mixture Models Clustering:**

A Gaussian mixture model is a probabilistic model that assumes all the data points are generated from a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters.

**DB Scan Clustering:**

DBSCAN is a clustering method that is used in machine learning to separate clusters of high density from clusters of low density. It's defined as in a given set of points in some space, it groups together points that are closely packed together (points with many nearby neighbors), marking as outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions (whose nearest neighbors are too far away).
